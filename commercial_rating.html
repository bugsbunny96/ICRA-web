            <h4>6-	Steps involved in Credit Rating Process at ICRA LLC</h4><br>
            <p>
                <strong>a-	Receiving formal request from Client</strong><br>
                The credit rating process begins when the issuer (who wants to get a credit rating) issues the formal request for credit rating to ICRA LLC along with necessary documents.

                <strong>d-	Research and financial statement analysis</strong><br>
                In this step, Credit Risk team research client’s operations, validate KYC documents, review the credit repayment history as per the given documents, analyze financial statements and cash flow projections.

                <strong>e-	Discussion meeting</strong><br>
                When all the analysis has been done, Credit Risk team will discuss the findings with the Board of Governors/Rating Committee, comprising senior management of ICRA LLC.

An opinion on the rating is also formed and the results of the team’s analysis are finally presented to the Board of Governors/Rating Committee. <br><br>

                <strong>f-	Rating Committee meeting</strong><br>

Now final authority will check facts, findings, and factors like political, social, and other factors. After considering all the results, facts, and other information the ICRA LLC will assign the actual Credit Rating. <br><br>

                <strong>g-	Communication of decision</strong><br>
